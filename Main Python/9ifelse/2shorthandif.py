#SHORT HAND IF
#If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
a= 45
b=60
if b>a : print('b is greater than a')

#SHORT HAND IF ELSE
#If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:
a= 45
b=60
print("B") if b>a else print('A')
